# AGENTS.md

Repository-level notes for agents working in this workspace.

## Layout

- `sparkrs/` — a Rust crate (`sparkrs`) that embeds a formal-verification
  engine: a bit-blasting SMT decision procedure, a symbolic DSL, a
  Curry–Howard proof kernel, contracts, and exhaustive verification.
  `no_std`, zero dependencies, allocation-free.

## Build and test commands

Rust is installed under `~/.cargo`; prepend it to `PATH` in every shell:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

```bash
cd sparkrs

# Host build + full test suite (needs the `std` feature for the thread-local arena)
cargo test --features std

# Lint (must stay at zero warnings)
cargo clippy --features std --all-targets

# Docs (must stay at zero warnings)
cargo doc --features std --no-deps

# Bare-metal: no std, no allocator, no dependencies
cargo build --no-default-features                       # host, exercises `static mut` path
cargo build --no-default-features --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf

# The flagship demo
cargo run --features std --example flight_control
```

`clippy` was installed with `rustup component add clippy`; the bare-metal target
with `rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf`.

## Architecture (read this before editing `smt.rs`)

`src/smt.rs` is the heart: bit-vector terms are bit-blasted into a Reduced
Ordered BDD. Invariants that are easy to break and hard to debug:

1. **Terminal nodes must have `var == u32::MAX`.** `top_var`/`cofactors` use that
   to mean "no variable here". `ensure_ready()` sets this. If it is wrong you get
   a non-canonical diagram and exponential blow-up, *not* an error.
2. **Every recursive cache must be cleared by `reset()`.** `reset()` clears
   `and_*`, `or_*`, `xor_*`, `not_*`, `uniq_*` and `term_*` in place (it must not
   use `*self = Ctx::new()`, which materialises a large stack temporary). Forgetting
   a cache leaves stale node ids pointing at recycled nodes, which produces a
   cycle and an infinite recursion (stack overflow).
3. **`neg()` must stay memoised.** Without the cache it walks shared subgraphs
   once per path, which is exponential; a few thousand nodes then takes minutes.
4. **Comparison ops (`Eq`/`Ult`/`Ule`) store the *operand* width**, not width 1.
   `blast` walks all operand bits and writes `out[0]`. Storing width 1 makes every
   comparison look at bit 0 only.
5. **BDD variable order** is `level_of` = interleaved bit-planes. This keeps
   adders/comparators linear. Changing it will silently make proofs slow or
   return `Unknown`.

## Conventions

- `Verdict::Unknown` is a first-class, correct answer when the node budget is
  exhausted. Never "fix" a proof by making the engine guess; either raise `CAP`
  or state a smaller-width obligation.
- Proofs that fail are usually mis-stated, not engine bugs. Verify a surprising
  result by hand (or with `exhaustive`) before touching the engine.
- The differential test (`tests/differential.rs`) is the trust anchor: symbolic
  proof and brute-force execution must agree, and symbolic counterexamples must
  be real.
- Keep the README honest about limits. Do not claim memory/aliasing/concurrency
  coverage; the logic is bit-vectors and booleans only.
